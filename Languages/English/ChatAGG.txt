I'm as good as dead. Good game.
It was fun while it lasted. But you can still win!
Sorry guys I gotta go. Have fun.
I hate n00bs! You made me loose!
Somehow, I can't help but blame this all on you.
Game over man, game over!!!
It's over for me.  Keep at it, you might get 'em.
The end is nigh!
I'm sorry, my friend. We have lost this game.
I apologize, my friend. We have failed this mission.
I regret, my friend. We have been defeated by the enemy.
I lament, my friend. We have fallen short of our goal.
I grieve, my friend. We have met our doom.
