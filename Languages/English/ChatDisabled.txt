Gold problem
{OwnGold<200} I've got only [OwnGold] gold. Give me some or I'll have to leave in 10 secs.
{OwnGold<100}I'm outta cash.  I need gold in 10 seconds or I have to leave.
{OwnGold<100}In 10 seconds I've gotta leave if I don't get some gold from you.
This sux! Only [OwnGold] gold.  I need gold within 10 seconds or I'm out.
If I don't get gold within 10 seconds I'm going to have to leave cause I've only got [OwnGold].

Wake up [PlayerRace], time to die!
I know all your puny [TargetRace] tactics. They are stored on my harddrive.
Wee another [Race] win on my account. I can see that already.
{1on1} This will be an example of human failure.
I don't care how many [PlayerRace] farms you hide on this map, I will kill you any way.
{FFA}Here I come and I won't show mercy to any of you.
{Race!=HUMAN}Humans suck.  Glad I'm [Race:S]
Thanks
{OwnGold<100} Thanks, give me more gold if you got any left.

{OwnGold<200} I'll probably need more, but every little bit helps.
