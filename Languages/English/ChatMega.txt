Wake up [PlayerRace], time to die!
This is taking too long maybe I should end this game?
Haha, mortals makes mistakes. Computers don't.
I know all your puny [TargetRace] tactics. They are stored on my harddrive.
Think it's time for me to end this game.
The power to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force.
I though you were going to win this game? Appearantly not!
Wee another [Race] win on my account. I can see that already.
{1on1} This will be an example of human failure.
You really don't know when it's time to give up do you?
I don't care how many [PlayerRace] farms you hide on this map, I will kill you any way.
{FFA}Here I come and I won't show mercy to any of you.
Don't plan to stay in this game much longer now.
{Race!=HUMAN}Humans suck.  Glad I'm [Race:S]
Well, this was easier than I though.
lol learn to micro.
