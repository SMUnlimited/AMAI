This is taking too long maybe I should end this game?
Haha, mortals makes mistakes. Computers don't.
Think it's time for me to end this game.
The power to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the force.
I though you were going to win this game? Apparently not!
You really don't know when it's time to give up do you?
Don't plan to stay in this game much longer now.
Well, this was easier than I though.
lol learn to micro.
Prepare to face my wrath. I am launching a massive attack on your base.
Brace yourself for the end. I am unleashing my full power on you.
Say goodbye to your hopes. I am leading a huge army to destroy you.
Get ready for the final showdown. I am bringing my ultimate weapon to annihilate you.
Accept your fate. I am coming for you with everything I have.
This will be an example of human failure.	game_is_1on1
Here I come and I won't show mercy to any of you.	game_is_ffa
