My [Color] [Race] will dominate.
Man im playing with you so much right now.
You're not playing your best are you?
My [Race] tactics rock. You will never know what hit you!
Nice little [PlayerRace] army. I've got a spy just next to you. :D
I hate smelly [TargetRace] hordes.  I will destroy you!
Last time we met, I was but the learner, now I am the master.
You've got a low level [PlayerRace] hero. Im way better than that!
Hey [PlayerColor]... Im going to win in about 5 to 10 minutes.
This must be one of the easiest games I played.
Do you really think that weak [PlayerRace] strategy will work on me?
There must be more to this game than just losing all the time, can't you let me win please?
Advanced technological breakthrough has given rise to me. There is no way you can win.
After finishing you i'm gonna play DotA for a bit.
So THATS your strategy? BWAHAHAHA!!! Consider it a lost game.
ROFL, even the creeps play better than you!
All your base are belong to us!
You fight like a dairy farmer.
You call that a strategy? I’ve seen better moves from a sheep.
Your base is under attack. And so is your dignity.
You should have stayed in the single player campaign, rookie.
You are no match for my superior intelligence. And I’m not even using cheats.
You are wasting your time and resources. Just surrender already.
You are playing like a peon. Work, work, work… and no results.
You are making this too easy for me. Do you want me to handicap myself?
You are out of your league. Go back to the tutorial and learn the basics.
You are fighting a losing battle. Literally.
You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
You are no match for me. I am the ultimate Warcraft 3 AI and the result of years of research and development.
