  <p><strong>DEVELOPER EDITION BLURB </strong></p>
  <p align="left">AMAI can be customized for your own personal needs in term of AI strategies and a lot of other gameplay settings like personal profiles. AMAI can also be customized to fit a Total Conversion for Warcraft 3 supporting custom units and abilities very easy with help of these instructions.<br />
    <br />
First you need to know what exactly the purpose of AMAI is and how it works.</p>
  <p align="left"> The purpose of AMAI is to be a automated dynamic AI for Warcraft 3 that works better and is much easier to edit than the original AI.Therefore when working with AMAI keep in mind that it's mostly automated and self adapting to most enviroments you can put it in.For example, don't try to make AMAI use a build order that you invented or read on a war3 strategy site or something like that, the result will be horrible. </p>
  <p align="left">Since AMAI finds it's own order, the only thing you need to care about is to set up clear goals of what you would like AMAI to accomplish and it will find it's own way there.</p>
  <p align="left"> If you got War3 AI experience:
    Previous experience with Warcraft 3 melee AI won't help you much when working with AMAI but it will make you understand very quickly how evolved AMAI really is.<br />
        <br />
    Originally War3 Melee AI was 3 parts of code for each race. The parts were build_sequence, upgrade_sequence and attack_sequence.The only one of these 3 parts that still exists in AMAI is the build_sequence but it's not working like the original build sequence that contained a build order, instead it contains 3 small lists of all goals you want the AI to acomplish for each tier.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>DEVELOPER EDITION INSTALL</strong></p>
