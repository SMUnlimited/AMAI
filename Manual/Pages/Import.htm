   <p class="style1">Import and Export - To exhange your strategies with others
</p>
   <p align="left">You can use the strategy maneger to insert and extract strategies and profiles very simple and by that you can also upload and download strategies and profiles from the internet.<BR>
We can easily try this by extracting the test strategy we already made in the strategy section or extract any other strategy that's already in AMAI.<BR>
Start the strategy maneger and select the strategy you want to extract, then hit the extract button to the right. </p>
   <p align="left"><img src="../images/Manager5.JPG" width="297" height="448"></p>
   <p align="left">Now you just have to give it a name and select where you want to save this strategy that will appear on the harddrive as a '.ais' file.<BR>
When done we can test the insert button by just click it and find the '.ais' file you just extracted and insert it in AMAI.<BR>
Since the strategy name is already there it will have a number added after it to prevent conflicts.</p>
   <p align="left"><img src="../images/Manager6.JPG" width="300" height="448"></p>
   <p align="left">But now you probably don't want 2 identical strategies in your AMAI so just remove the new strategy again by selecting it and hit the remove button.<BR>
<BR>
The same extract and insert methods can be used on profiles, only exception is that they will use the file format '.aip'.<BR>
<BR>
You can find an online AMAI strategy database via <A href="http://www.wc3campaigns.net/amai" target="_blank">AMAI's home page. </A>Use it to upload or download strategies and profiles. </p>
