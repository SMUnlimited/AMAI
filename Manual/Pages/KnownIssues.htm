  <p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong></p>
  <p align="center">Below is a list of bugs/ issues/ features we are fixing or developing for a future version</p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Features for future versions</strong><br>
- Sea/air expansion support (Code improvements that have been made to the zepplin code make air expansions more viable and will be worked as an extension of the zepplin systems) 
<br>
- Double Expansion system ( expanding to two expansions at same time )
<br>
  - Use of Marketplaces to be implemented and choose the super items before lesser items. 
  <br>
  - Improved creeping tactics i.e. use tank to get him having all the damage, weaken creeps, attack the dangerous creep first <br>
  - Humans should cast invisibility on units going to merchant/shops/fountains <br>
  - More varied difficulty of play when choosing insane or normal or easy. Easy will not do many features, normal will play its best but with less map hacking abilities. e.g. it has to use more actual visible evidence, insane map hacks everything. <br>
  - When amai is in an attack but needs an item, it will make use of units with the backpack upgrade to get the item so that the hero dosn't get used. Then the unit will go back to the hero.
  <br>
  - Focus fire script to include certain disabling spells, e.g. entangling roots, ensnare, purge, polymorph etc. <br>
  - Improvement to Job system so if you really really need to use a wait in jobs, it will work without messing up the entire system. 
  <br>
  - Wisps waiting for a gold mine to finish should be harvesting the nearby trees.<br>
  - Night elf needs to be able to balance its gold/lumber wisp ratio. <br>
    - Fast Build improved to allow any building to be built fast. <br>
    - Rush bonus of heroes should contain strength of summons. As the hero can summon creatures with those strength. This change would require the strengths of hero summons to be 0. (May not implement- just an Idea)<br>
    - Allow custom modification of the strengths of units for mod/map compatability that may not use food usage and unit level as a correct form of strength measurement.<br>
    - Front locations could also be calculated by going the opposite direction from the enemy as well as too the enemy. This is because enemies might take different routes to the route amai might take. <br>
  - Hero Harass Attacks <br>
  - In FFA first player that attacks AMAI, amai will get extra aggression and more likely to attack that player and build counter units of that player. <br>
  - Use of blademaster and seige to town portal into an enemies town using the mini great hall item. </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Confirmed Issues</strong></p>
  <p align="left">-------TECHINCAL BUGS--------- <br>
    - If you try to install or uninstall AMAI on a map currently in use by warcraft3 or WorldEditor the installer will crash.<br>
  - AMAI might require a lot of CPU power from your computer. Especially on games with 8 or more players.<br>
   ( We will continue to find memory leaks to further improve memory usage and prevent laggy situations occuring)  </p>
  <p align="left">-------GAMEPLAY BUGS--------- <br>
    - Team Game Teleportation only occurs to nearest allied start location not expansion locations.<br>
    - Problem with ai not harvesting resources or/and trying to get gold in an emergency. i.e. there main base destroyed and then just sit doing nothing. 
    <br>
    - Tauren cheiftain should use town portal only if reincarnation not ready or researched.
    <br>
  -AMAI doesn't communicate amongst itself very well. Red and Green get in a fight,   and Red kills everything it can see. Despite Green being right there and   fighting still, Red now wanders off to do something else. Green is now fighting   overwhelming odds and loses horribly. It shouts for help and Red comes running.   Of course, Green has fled and now Red is fighting horribly overwhelming odds and   dies horribly.<br>
  -AMAI should retreat to the nearest friendly base, not one it owns in team games.
  <br>
  - Double Expansions are one thing which messed up AMAI teleporting as are not being detected correctly then enemy builds tower and AMAI sees threat and tries to teleport and cannot.<br>
  - Team players do not register threats of enemies in ally towns and can cause defeat as computers get outnumbered easily. 
  <br>
  - AMAI tries to teleport to a town when the townhall has not yet finished construction. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left">-------DEVELOPER BUGS---------<br>
    - Some sections of code are still non-modabble. Which could mean problems for mods. Some examples are ward checks and zepplins. (e.g.can only have 1 zepplin unit type otherwise others get overridden) <br>
    <span class="style3"><strong>Note</strong>: There is currently an issue with using the default AMAI on custom melee maps that dont use the latest melee patch data. AMAI will just not work past tier 1. </span></p>
  <p align="left">-------HARDCODED/ DIFFICULT TO FIX BUGS---------- 
  <br>
    - Orbs should not be brought by heros with orb abilities [Blizzard controlled]<br>
    - Hawk from beastmaster level 1 should not be casted as not needed [Blizzard controlled]<br>
    - Hero should destroy non needed items on the ground if cannot pick up [not easy to control]<br>
    - When amai loses an expansion. It still tries to send lumber harvesters there to harvest lumber [not easy to control]<br>
    - Microing units with lightning sheild on away to prevent damage to army. [ not easy to control] <br>
    - Some unit spells are not used effectivly[Blizzard controlled] 
    <br>
  - Sometimes computers base can get extremly cramped and is more common with nightelf [Partly Blizzard Controlled] <br>
  - AMAI changes its attack targets often. Unfortunatly this is due to focus fire systems conflicting with blizzards in built target systems. <br>
  - Illusions and summons are healed (Now only a hardcoded issue) <br>
  - If all peasants are killed on a constructed building when human race, all peasants go to fast build it leaving no rescources [Blizzard Controlled]<br>
  - AMAI sometimes will mass build millions of towers at expansion and not stop [Possibly blizzard bug - Researching]
