  <p align="center" class="style1">Final Stable Release </p>
  <div align="left">
    <p>The next version of amai has finally reached a status worthy of a stable release. This has been a major project which resulted in massive changes to the underlying code. This is the first major update to amai since January 2005 where the new year edition was released. I would like to give my thanks to all the play testers of the betas who helped make this final release possible. You guys provided a wealth of valuable information and suggestions that made this possible. See you all again for the development of 2.51 ;) and have fun playing warcraft. </p>
    <p>This  massive release features a wealth of improvements and bug fixes. Due to the amount of bugs and changes  made it is unfeasible to list every single possible change ever made so below lists most of the major improvements from 2.43. If your upgrading your custom AMAI read the developer edition change log below for help but due to the amount of changes it will take a bit of work to get working. </p>

      <li>Undead now can build necropolis at expansions.</li>

      <li>Major new micro management of units with correct usage of racial shops to heal units. </li>

      <li>
        <div align="left">Fixed a bug in militia expansion where it would suicide the creeps with all its peasants if its initial wave was stopped </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">Fixed a bug where blizzard ai's built multiple town halls, couldn't expand correctly and had some conversion issues. </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">Massive language update check through to see what really needs translating or not </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">Wheel of Chaos map is now confirmed fixed as to AMAI being able to play fine on the map </div>

      </li>
      <li>Chinese language has been disabled due to needs proper translation. </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center">AMAI DEVELOPER IMPROVEMENTS </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AMAI common.ai now nativly supports scripts made in the world editor and original blizzard ai scripts.   ( There is only one possible issue that can occur with pure custom scripts please see the AMAI vs AI section for details ) </li>
      <li>AMAI simple edition now uses grimoire to run AMAI which allows support for running warcraft with parameters and enabling the debugging tools.</li>
      <li>Debugging tools of AMAI have been greatly improved with a new system that displays debug info above the unit in question instead of spamming text screen with messages causing a slow down. </li>
      <li> minimum and maximum is now superseded by Min and Max function calls.</li>
      <li>        DisplayToAllDebug function is now called Trace but no functionality has changed.</li>
      <li> Added 'mine' type that determines version gold mines to standardunits.txt. </li>
      <li> Added 'lumber' type that determines the drop off point structures so they are built next to trees to standardunits.txt </li>
      <li> Added 'zigg' type to determine structures that are ziggurats to standardunits.txt</li>
      <li>DefendsTownCond now has an extra parameter max_dist </li>
      <li>Instead of using the disable retreat setting a new text file called standardaisettings has been created that allows you to modify all the blizzard controlled settings (ones that appear in ai editor) including disabling unit retreating etc. You can also see which settings are controlled by AMAI and changing them will not make a blind bit of difference.</li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">A new advanced upgrade function has been added.<br>
            <em>BuildAdvUpgrade([quantity], [upgrade], [start tier],[unit count],[start unit count],[tier start count bonus],[tier prority bonus],[base priority]) </em><br>
          This function will build upgrade when unit count greator then the start count with a prority of (base priority * unit count). It only takes affect at the designated start tier and then builds at first 1 only, then increases every tier till it reaches the quantity level specified in the function. This function adds dynamic approach to upgrades so AMAI does upgrades based on the number of units. </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">Added a compile AMAI vs AI version button. This compiles the TFT version scripts into the AMAI vs AI executable. This means tweaks you make to AMAI you can then test out your own tweaks easily against the standard AI without doing the long route of using an MPQ tool manually. (And to be honest it was getting annoying for myself) </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">Improvements to the heroes.txt. Has extra first hero, second hero, third hero bonuses for each hero. This provides more power for hero selection to make more accurate accurate hero choices by AMAI. </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">MassHealing.txt file has been replaced with the new HealingItems.txt file. There are 4 types of healing items available. HEALINGITEM_MASS, HEALINGITEM_SINGLE, MERCHANTITEM_MASS,HEALINGITEM_HERO</div>
      </li>
      <li>New profile surrender value which has settings between 0 and 4. 0 is the default blizzard value in this case never gives up. While 4 means the profile gives up extremly easy. 1 is the original surrender system for amai. </li>
      <li>A Global setting has been added which provides whether or not this amai version has heroes. Turning off will not prevent heroes from being trained as such if its in there strategy but it makes attack assaults  not wait upon a hero. </li>
      <li>A Global Setting added that turns off the blizzard controlled retreating. This is only useful for amai's that are used with units of extremly low health where such retreating style is not effective.</li>
      <li>A global Setting to set all computers to have the name &quot;Computer&quot; instead of their profile name.</li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">Fixed a bug related to having an empty UnitEquivelence.txt file which caused the compilor to complain about a missing endif. </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">Maps that use the set custom value of unit native or coressponding trigger are now compatible with amai.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">Level Strength Map text file has become redundent and is no longer used due to enhanced strength calculations.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div align="left">3 new global settings have been added for the strength bonus that is added depending on if a creep camp is minor or major.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p align="center"><strong>We have made some major improvements to amai code as stated above. Therefore to allow your customized 2.43 amai to work in this new version you will need to make the following changes.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The &quot;SetBuildUnit&quot; &quot;SetBuildItem&quot; &quot;SetBuildUpgr&quot; commands are now &quot;BuildUnit&quot; &quot;BuildItem&quot; &quot;BuildUpgr&quot; respectively.</li>
      <li>The reference to a hero e.g. hero_id[1] or hero_id[2] is now references as hero[1] or hero[2]</li>
      <li>Then click the applytablechanges.pl to create the nessecary variable additions to tables. (Note some global settings do not get added correctly so you will have to compare manually) </li>
      <li>These only affect AMAI code. The reason for the changes is to allow the standard blizzard ai codes to work. Therefore &quot;SetBuildUnit&quot; would call the standard build code which will cause issues if called in AMAI scripts. </li>
    </ul>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Undead will now build necropolis or graveyards depending on how far away mine is and its amount of rescources. This is to try and prevent issue of undead running out of wood as ghouls just stayed at main base to harvest.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Undead now go to goblin merchant to get healing scrolls if its not tier 3.</div>
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Town threat no threat distance is now set to 3000 from 3250 to try and reduce effects of an issue on maps where bases are really close together that makes AMAI always think its base is threatened. This is only a temp fix. The army control systems will either just need more global setting changes or a re-write. </div>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>BETA 8 UPDATES</strong></p>
  <p>AMAI ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue where language selection does not work it is always english. (cause was due to too many threads, had to merge 2 threads together as warcraft only supports 5 threads before reusing old ones) </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue where nightelf would not harvest from expansion gold mines. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed issue on large maps with multiple taverns an issue where it could not detect a tavern. This resulted in it training a normal hero from its altar as replacement and is what caused the heros not choosing skills due to unfixable limitations. This should no longer occur. (custom maps with unreachable or guarded taverns will still result in the normal replacement hero being trained who will still have no skills. This issue is unfixable due to limitations in the script core) </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Strategy upgrades have been further reworked with new dynamic upgrades by implementing a new build advanced upgrade function. These are upgrades that are built based on the number of units. So if amai has alot of priests, amai is more likely going to do the priest upgrades. Also fixed an error with nightelves strategies as it was using a badly implemented testing dynamic upgrade system and wasn't working well.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed issue where micro scripts failed to check as regulary as before. I had left some values from tests so by next check unit would already be dead so resulted in computer losing too many units early. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Reduced the distance that AMAI can do a militia expansion to 6500 from 8000 as i have tested and this seems to be the best range where militia expansion attacks are more succesful as the mine isn't far away. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Increased focus fire melee distance from 80 to 200 so that focus fire in melee has a better surround attack, not increased too high though so that melee units suicide themselves trying to attack a unit it can't reach. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Increased flee health percentage from 0.25 to 0.3, this is more in line with when the invisibility spell is cast by blizzards hardcoded systems to protect units.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue where focus fire was only running for units that needed healing. Its now the otherway round as it should be. Also made improvements in detection of units and better detection of immobilised units and buildings. </div>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Added a micro hero rule so it dosn't waste a town portal when hero is dying and only 1 or 2 friendly units left. (Should fix issues when hero townportals while creeping) </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue in night elf strategies where it was heavily building units that are not actually a part of the strategy, so in effect the actual units from strategy dont appear to be built because these other units had higher prority. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Other racial strategy improvements to fix issues such as amai ending up always picking the similar strategy. e.g. human would nearly always build sorceress every game so building the counter was all that was required to win </div>

    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue where focus fire was incorrectly calculating its own range strength by including dead ranged units .</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue where heroes would still buy items from the goblin merchant even when town was threatened and also improved so heroes will not buy items when they are in an attack. Loss of an important hero when attacking is a bad idea. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue where if the other hero was in the selection of the shop and another hero wants to use the shop it cant as selection was on another hero. </div>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed issue related to AMAI retreating from battle but then changing its mind while being chased. Now fixed to make AMAI return home. This only occurs when AMAI retreated, otherwise it chooses its next target like usual.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Increased the priority to build the emergency healing items when army needs healing. Hopefully will fix issue of orc AMAI players not healing its army. </div>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Added improvements to amai team play so that team follows a lead AMAI player. If that leader dies than the team leader switches to someone else.

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed bug in the retreat army code resulting in it not working properly and also made some small improvements where will overide the blizzard calculations and retreat straight away if in a vastly losing situation.

  <p>AMAI ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Removed the old heal army function call which would heal the army when preparing an attack.

    </li>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left"> Fixed code duplication issues that was caused by having the same function repeated but would remove the location or group passed to it. This makes making changes complicated. All destruction of local variables should be done in the function that it was declared in. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue that was causing the ancient_exp_loc variable to be cleared instead of kept so ancient expansion issues would occur. </div>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue with AMAI attacking center of map. This issue did not really affect beta 4 but was present just never activated. Was to do with an incorrect variable being set to null. </div>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Fixed an issue where strength levels picked up hidden units (i.e. used by custom maps and certain AMAI calculations). This messed up the strength system and now should no longer think army is really strong. </div>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Changed handling of ancient expansion slightly. Before the expansion would only use the one type of unit to aid. This could be damaging as it would inaccurately mesure strength against creeps as most units stay put and risked life of the tree. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Human towerrush disabled until we can create a new repair system to fix the blizzard bug of sending every peasant to repair a building when its builders are killed. (if you want it back on you can turn on in develper human settings) </div>

    <li>
    <div align="left">New save unit features: using moon wells with mana till unit/hero is healed and heroes buy health potions in emergency and use them straight away instead of not buying anything till attack finishes or waiting for hard coded blizzard ai to kick in. This feature is an early code layout for a more advanced item usage/micro system. </div>

    </li>
    <li>
  <div align="left">Fixed an issue with humans where if tower rush is true and millitia is true then human players got messed up at start. Also moved tower rush attack code into single melee attack which removed some problems in not creeping. </div>
    </li>
    <li>
  <div align="left">Zepplin usage seems to be functioning correctly again without any input from myself. Side effect of fixing another bug somehow?</div>
    </li>
    <li>
  <div align="left">Improved mana fountain integration with micro systems. (I can now say on maps which only have the mana fountain i have seen this used alot more so was able to fix noticeable bugs and such.) </div>
    </li>
    <li>
  <div align="left">Aiandies old pathing is now fully obsolete. The new system is much more simple and effectively start lag is no more and still works in calculating front positions for towers, nearest mines, nearest shops etc.The old system was a great peice of code but it was not effecient especially when being wasted on simplistic tasks. </div>

    </li>
    <li>
      <div align="left">Improved the expansion system to take into account if it needs to re-build a destroyed mine. If the town hall is destroyed but its towers or other buildings remained intact it will have a higher prority to re-build expansion there then build an expansion somewhere else. It can still build another expansion elsewhere. Depending on feedback we can make it so AMAI always re-builds in this case before anything else. </div>
