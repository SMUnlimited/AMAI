  <p><strong>AMAI vs AI EDITION </strong></p>
  <p align="left">From AMAI V2.50 it is now possible to play against standard blizzard created ai's at the same time while playing against AMAI. This was once possible to do in older builds but  became a much more complicated procedure till down right impossible. </p>
  <p align="left">This has been reversed and now all standard blizzard ai's and campaign ai's and custom standard/campaign ai's will all work with no changes required at all. This allows possibilities of having amai play against a standard computer and improves possibilites of play for campaigns. You may also find it easier to write standard ai's as all the units can be set up in the AMAI editor, compile to get a common.ai file and now just write your racial script without long hassle of modifying the common.ai file manually. </p>
  <p align="left">To start playing AMAIvsAI just double click the executable.
  Afterwards start up a single or LAN match like normal with some ai opponents.  .<br>
  This special version specifically will make odd players AMAI while even players are standard ai players. <br>
  </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Developer edition instructions</strong></p>
  <p align="left">AMAI 2.50 developer edition has a Compile AMAI vs AI button that will compile the version and then add the blizzard entertainment scripts(as determined in the races.txt file) to AMAI (NOTE: You cannot use the player edition to install this version on particlar maps) </p>
  <p align="left">Blizzard.j file is created using a specially created blizzardVAI.eai file. The default blizzard ai scripts are labelled human2.ai, orc2.ai etc. </p>
  <p align="left">Replacing the &quot;race&quot;2.ai file codes with your own ai made in either editor or just written for the original ai can be put here instead and that ai will be compiled in the amai vs ai edition. Again you can change which file these are named in the versions races.txt file. </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>Instructions to convert your other original ai scripts to be compatible with AMAI ( </strong><em>This section requires knowledge in extracting from an mpq</em>)</p>
  <p align="left">As an example we will use the standard blizzard human.ai script to show how to make any script compatible. </p>
  <p align="left"><strong>1) </strong>First extract the standard melee ai script (e.g. human.ai ) from the war3x.mpq or get ready your custom made script</p>
  <p align="left">2)Make sure 'call StandardAI' or 'call CampaignAI' or PickMeleeHero or 'Init Ai'is one of your first functions in your main section of the script. If it isn't and unit names are used before those calls then make sure 'call InitAiUnits()' is placed at top of the main section. This makes sure unit ID's use the default Ai's way instead of AMAI's way of naming unit IDs. </p>
  <p align="left">2)Next you have two options. You can either place your amai file  in your amai's Script/TFT/ folder and replace human2.ai file with yours or  add the file directly to the created AMAI.mpq using winmpq or something similar. Make sure you rename your script to human2.ai. Then open the developer edition and click compile AMAI vs Ai. This allows you to test all your own original scripts against AMAI. Great for ai tournaments me thinks. </p>
  <p align="left">3) Another option is to leave the ai named as something like myorcai.ai then place in the TFT folder. Next open up TFT\Races.txt and change the 'orc2.ai' to 'myorcai.ai. Clicking compile AMAI vs AI will now put your custom ai in for the orc ai.You can then play using the exe and the race you added will be the standard ai. NOTE: AMAI will pjass your custom script to see if it appears to be compatible with AMAI files. </p>
  <p align="left">4) And thats it easy isn't it. You can now experiment with this feature as you will. Either by making a war3 scenario that has different ai scripts some ai and some amai. You could provide players a choice of which ai player could choose. The options are limitless. Mod designers may find this feature useful as campaigns can use standard ai made in blizzards ai editor while melee maps can use the normal amai without any conflicts. </p>
