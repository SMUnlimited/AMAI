<p align="center"><strong>AMAI SIMPLE EDITION </strong></p>
<p>The simple edition is the easiest way of starting a game against the ai. </p>
<p>To start playing AMAI just double click one of the exe files provided to play. Choose either AMAI_TFT (frozen throne) or AMAI_ROC (reign of chaos). </p>
<p>Afterwards start up a single or LAN match like normal with some ai opponents.<br />
Congrats you can now play the map against and/or with computers to make use of AMAI.</p>
<p>There will be language selection dialogs to select a language. Another dialog may also appear with options to either</p>
<p>1) No Commander<br />
2) With Commander - The Commander allows you to give orders to your ally friends. Press 'ESC' to bring up the commander menu. <br />
  3) Computers Only - Same as commander except you dont play at all and instead can only issue orders to try and make your ally ai win</p>
<p align="center"><strong>ADVANCED INSTALL EXTRAS</strong></p>
<p align="left">From amai 2.50 onwards you can now run the amai executable with other parameters. Open the script.lua in notepad and go to the line with the following<br /> 
  <br />
proc = startexe(path..  &quot;\\war3.exe&quot;,&quot;war3.exe &quot;..getargs())</p>
<p align="left">Example below  will open warcraft in a window instead of full screen. Save the file once done and run the exe. <br />
  proc = startexe(path..  &quot;\\war3.exe&quot;,&quot;war3.exe -window&quot;..getargs())<br />
  <br />
  This method supports all the usual parameters you might use with warcraft including -opengl and -classic <br />
