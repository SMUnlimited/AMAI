thanks to Jeff Pang for the handy documentation that this was based
on at http://jass.sourceforge.net/
Released under the BSD license

To use this program, list the files you would like to parse in order.
If you would like to parse from standard input (the keyboard), then
use - as an argument.  If you supply no arguments to pjass, it will
parse the console standard input by default.

To test this program:
pjass common.j common.ai Blizzard.j
